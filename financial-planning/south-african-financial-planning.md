# Notes on South African Financial Planning

# 1. Principles and Practice of FInancial Planning

* FAIS (Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services) Act implemented for more financial stability and market conduct - protecting and treating clients fairly.
* Better protection from clients from unethical and incompetent operators

### Nature of Financial Products and Services

Intangible - cannot be seen, felt or touched - making it harder to make a decision.

Issues faced in the industry:

* Financial literacy
* Lack of confidence in finance industry
* Information difficult to understand and not highly accessible
* Lack of transparency
* Errors of omission, misleading client
* Difficult for clients to detect misrepresentation
* Difficult to know the full cost of the product
* Cannot be tested prior to purchase
* Client's future depends on performance, you can't just return a faulty product
* No guarantees

### Definition Financial Planning

Guidance to acheive financial and lifestyle goals

FPI (Financial Planning Institute) definition:

> Financial planning is the process of developing strategoes to assist clients in managing their financial affairs to meet life and financial goals. The process of financial planning involves reviewing all the relevant aspects of the client's current situation and comparing them with the client's desired situation and designing a plan to assist the client on the journey of financial independence

Things ot take into account in creating a plan:

* Personal factors: age, lifestyle, current portfolio, attitude to risk, financial responsibilities
* Lifestyle and lifestyle goals
* Financial objectives - how to achieve those goals
* Time-frames: short, medium, long

### Benefits of Financial Planning

Clients more likely to achieve desired financial and lifestyle goals. Enchance the growth of assets and give more control over financial affairs. Does not mean guaranteed great wealth.

* Maintaining a balance of capital and income
* Protecting against financial risk
* Maintaining the value and purchasing power of capital
* Legitamately minimising taxation
* Acceptable level of investment return
* Financial independence at retirement
* Appropriate structure of liabilities and debt reduction
* security for the family
* balancing timing of cash outflow and inflow
* balancing current lifestyle with future lifestyle
* regular reviews of the financial plan

> The industry used to be very sales focussed - the ultimate aim of the meeting was to sell a product. It is important to note that long term the interests of the client must be paramount.

### Resistance to Financial Planning

* Financial planning is not just purchasing or investing in financial products
* Clients fail to see importance of monitoring and annual review
* Clients have mounting debt
* It is a low priority in their busy and challenging lives
* Previous negative experiences with financial planners and product suppliers
* Perception of an industry being sales-driven and not solutions and service-driven

## Competencies and skills

Be professional - continually develop and master competencies and skills

### Legal and Technical

Knowing when you don't have the skills to advise the client.
Do not give advice in an area where you do not have the required experise.

### Building Relationships of Trust

Trust - Firm belief in the reliability or truth of a person

High trust relationships are characterised by character and competence.

If trust is broken, it can be almost impossible to re-establish

# 2. Ethics and Professional Standards

Members of the public lose confidence and trust as well as their hard-earned money, their life-savings.
Only strong ethical principles of an individual and industry level will limit unethical behaviour.
Ethics - character and personal disposition for choosing right from wrong
Morals - societal values held collectively

Simply obeying the laws does not mean you are being ethical. You need to do right by the client.

## The importance of ethical behaviour

Global financial crisis and scandals like Enron, Worldcom, Steinhoff, HSBC money laundering and Valeant Pharmaceuticals have decreased confidence.

Important to follow the FAIS General Code of Conduct (GCC) and the King IV report on corporate governance.

## Levels of Ethics

### Personal Ethics

Right or wrong based on your own principles using approprate self-interest.

**Principles**

>  Integrity, Responsibility, justice, fairness, forgiveness, generosity, compassion, self-discipline, wisdom, courage, care for all living things and environment

**Values**

> Achievement, power, creativity, wealth, comfort, status, health, service, open-mindedness, meaningful work and challenge

### Professional Ethics

According to the FPSB (Financial planning standards board) these are 4 major trends:

\* Consumer demand
* Focusing on relationship rather than transactions
* Regulatory changes
* Globalisation

**Business Ethics**

* Through ethical eadership
* Creating and maintaining an ethical culture
* Zero tolerance for unethical behaviour

## Ethical Transgressions

Has alot to do with upbringing, socialisation, culture and society

* Deception
* Stealing
* Harming

Once a lie has been figured out by the client, it is hard for the client to trust you ever again.

## Factors Contributing to unethical behaviour

* Self-interest - commision, salaries and profit
* Some do not prioritise ethical behaviour
* Hard for cleints to assess products and services before making the purchase
* Inherent power imbalance between client, financial planner and product supplier - complex and difficult to understand increasing reliance on planner

**Ethical Traps**
* Obedience to authority
* Conformity Bias
* Incrementalism - lowering standards
* Groupthink - pressure - making bad decisions
* Over-optimism
* Over-confidence
* Self-serving bias
* Framing
* Sunk costs - instead of abondoning a deteriorating situation
* Intanigible far removed affect

## Perception of Unethical behaviour in financial service industry

Service industry is large: banks, insurance companies, asset management and pension funds.

## Ethical Issues in the Financial Services Industry

Self-serving bias can make it difficult for financial planners to be objective when giving advice as monetary incentives can impact on the judgement of even the most well-intentioned person.

A strong ehtical culture is required.

### Tests of Ethical behaviour

* Utilitarian principle - greatest good for greatest number of people
* Kant's categorical imperitive - acting in a way that is universal law
* The professinoal ethic - a disinterested panel of professionals would view as proper
* The platinum rule - treat other people the way they would like to be treated
* Television / newspaper test - comfotable explaining their actions in a newspaper or on tv
* Family test - explaining to family members

### Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

**FAIS Act for all Financial Service Providers (FSP)**

> Act honestly and fairly, and with due skill, care and diligence, in the interest of clients and integrity of the financial servies industry

* Honesty, fairness, due skill, care, diligence, interests of clients, integrity

Ethical obligations:

\* Trust
* Confidentiality
* Adequate disclosure
* Respect of client
* Right of client to accessible information
* Right of client to appropriate knowledge and skills

**FPI Code of Ethics and Practice Standards**

Eight principles:

\* Client First - Did I act in the ebst interest of the client?
* Integrity - Am I prepared to read about my actions in tomorrow's newspaper?
* Objectivity - Did I not allow emotins to cloud my judgement?
* Fairness - Have I done what a reasonable person would ahve done? Would I do the same in the future.
* Competence - Do I have the sufficently updated knowledge to render the best advice?

## Conclusions

Ethical dilemmas may arise and it is important to become aware of small transgressions day to day.
For example, you sell a client a financial product that offers a higher rate of commission when you know it carries a high degree of risk and is not appropriate for the client at all or you churn a policy because you need to reach a sales target.

_A lot more words in this chapter_

# 7. Personal Financial Management

An important aspect, **often overlooked** in favour of risk, investment or retirement planning

Answers whether client is living within their means, whether emergency fund is adequate and what different demands on cash flow are.

## Gathering Information

* Assets and Liabilities
* Income and Expenditure

### Statement of Assets and Liabilities

**Assets**

* Liquid Assets - readily available
    * Cash
    * Money in savings/current account
    * Money market funds
* Fundamental assets - functional assets
    * houses
    * motor vehicles
    * personal property: furniture, clothing, jewellery
* Investment assets - acquired to earn a return
    * securities - shares / fixed interest bearing investments
    * cash value of insurance policies
    * fixed deposits
    * unit trusts
    * investment property
    * offshore investments
    * hard assets - art, gold, etc

Important to know who owns the asset
Whether the asset is ceded as security
Property has a mortgage bond on it
Assets are valued at the fair market value

**Liabilities**

ie. Debt

* Short Term Liabilities
    * Overdraft
    * Credit Card
    * Loans
* Long-tem liabilities
    * Mortgage bond on property

At this point recommendations can be made to pay off debt or keep invested

If the interest payable on debt is greater than after-tax investment return then it is advisable to pay off debt

> Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities

### Cash Flow Statement

Income and expenditure - source of income, amount of income and how the income is being used.

Sources of income: salary, rental income, dividends, royalties, interest
Expenses: household and personal needs, funding of lifestyle and repayment of debt

> A client who is single with no dependants is likely to have a better cash flow and will be able to invest more surplus cash than a family with young dependants

Cash flow is **actual**, budget is an **estimate**.

## Budgeting

Gives a sense of control, identfies areas of overspending and gives a sense of control

### Importance of Budgeting

* Encourages involvement
* responsibility
* Identified problems and where money is spent
* Idnetifies priorities
* Encourages financial responsibility
* Gives realistic expectations
* Allows to set time frames for goals

### Drawing  budget

Income
Expenses
Profit/Loss

When there is a cumulative loss you either have to **earn more money** or **reduce expenses**
_Reducing expenses_ is usually the easiest thing to do

## Emergency Fund Planning

Funds immediately available in the event of an emergency
Eliminating the need for certain short term insurance
The funds should be invested in a **low-risk investment** such as a bank or money-market fund.
Credit cards, personal loans, overdraft facility should be avoided if possible

### Reasons for an Emergency Fund

* Loss of Employment
* Illness / accidence
* Disability
* Loss of business
* loss of income
* divorce, speration or death of spouse
* market not conducive to sale of asset

## Basic Financial Ratios

On there own may be less useful but are good in seeing trends

### Solvency Ratio

Net worth to total assets as a percentage. Low solvency for higher levels of debt, high solvency for couples nearing retirement and have paid off debt.

    solvency_ratio = net_worth / total_assets * 100

### Liquidity Ratio

Compares liquid assets with current debt. Cash and 12 month cash equivalents vs amount of debt to be repaid within 12 months. Shows how many months of debt can be funded if income increases, a higher liquidity ratio is important to conservative clients:

    liquidity_ratio = liquid_assets / current_dent * 100

### Savings Ratio

Level of savings as a percentage of total income. Savings is the amount left over after deducting expenditure from income (use after tax income) and any amounts paid into investments.

    savings_ratio = savings / total_income * 100

### Debt Service Ratio

Monthly debt commitments as a percentage of gross monthly income:

    monthly_debt_service_ratio = ((annual_debt_commitments / 12) / (annual_gross_income / 12)) * 100

Impacts decisions to increase debt with a big purchase or to stop full time work

## Debt Management

* Credit - power to buy and borow on trust
* Debt - something that is owed

Debt can be useful if used sparingly. When buying an item  where the price is guarenteed to rise in the future fast than interest on the debt.

Over-indebtedness - Unable to pay credit obligations on time

Important to know if client has unexpected short term debt or it is chronic long-term debt

Reasons for getting into debt:

\* mismanagement of finances
* undisciplined buying habits
* poor advice
* loss of income
* excessive lifestyle
* unexpected costs
* retrenchment
* unexpected medical expenses

Recommendations and strategies:

\* reduce spending on unnecessary items
* pay off debt with highest interest rate first
* transfer expensive debt to lower interest rate
* debt consolidation - consolidate smaller loans into one large one
* liquidate investments to pay off debt
* pay additional amounts into mortgage bond
* destroy credit cards and use a debit card

> Refer a client that is unable to manage debt to a debt counsellor

* A debt counsellor restructures debt so client still has enough for basic needs and credit gets paid. 
* Creditors must approve repayment plan
* Avoids cost of going to court and declaring client insolvent
* During debt counselling creditors cannot take legal action, cannot repossess and client cannot take loans.
* If none of the methods are effective, the client is declared insolvent and assets will be converted to cash to repay debtors.

## Types of Credit

Maximum Interest Rates

* Mortgage Agreements - `repo_rate * 2.2 + 5%` per **year**
* Credit facilities / other credit - `repo_rate * 2.2 + 10%` per **year**
* Unsecured credit / developmental credit agreements - `repo_rate * 2.2 + 20%` per **year**
* short term credit transactions - `5%` per **month**
* incidental credit agreements - `2%` per **month**

The credit provider cannot charge a higher rate (penalty) on overdue payments

### Supplier Accounts

This is telephone, water and electricity accounts where a service/priduct is received and payment is due sme time after that. After 20 days it becomes incidenetal credit at a max of `2% per month`

### In-store Credit

* Read the agreement on credit limit, repayment period, interest rates, changes, fees, terminatino etc
* Interest free for a few months - the prices in the store have been marked up to cover the delay in receiving the money. Cash paying customer pay the same price, subsidising the credit account customers
* Best advice is to not buy items on account, rather save and pay cash

### Store loans

* For fridges and furniture
* R1000 - R10000
* Rate: 2 - 7% more than prime rate (very expensive)

### Credit cards

Advantages:

* Reduce amount of cash required
* Credit limit
* No interest for 45 days
* Medium term budget facility for larger purchases - set of tyres, camera, new fridge or tv
* Max monthly fee is R50

### Overdraft

* Allows current account to be overdrawn
* Interst is very high
* Should be avoided except by small business owner needing to buy supplies for future sales

### Personal Loan

* Similar to overdraft
* High interest rates
* Not linked to bank account
* Any bank
* Fixed amount, fixed period, fixed interest rate
* Up to 3 times gross monthly income
* Can be used to consolidate debt (pay off higher interest debt)

### Revolving Credit

* Similar to overdraft
* High interest rate
* Up to 5 times gross monthly salary
* Can draw up to limit again when repayments put balance owing less than 75%

### Insurance Policies

Certain policies like endowments allow clients to borrow against them. This should only be a last resort.

### Medium term financing

* To buy an expensive item, it is unlikely the client has the savings.
* Company can repossess the item if monthly payments are not made
* Interest rates charged can be above prime and chcange when prime changes
* Fixed interest rates are usally offered at times when interest rates are high and expected to drop. **Usually a fixed interest rate should be avoided.**
* In certain circumstances the interest calculated on the capital amount and for the full period of the agreement. The reducing balance method is much cheaper and therefore advisable to use the budget facility on your credit card instead of using hire purchase.

**Financing a motor vehicle**

* Usually the second largest purchase a client will unlikely have the money
* Maximum of 60 months

For client deriving income from vehicle:

\* Not required to pay deposit
* Asset regarded as belonging to the client, tax dedcuations are based on actual costs (if you use the vehicle for business)
* Can choose to structure with a residual (balloon) amount of 0 to 40%.
* Higher residual or more steeply structured the repayments - higher the interestd charges
* Can reduce repayments in the first year and increase along with car allowance, salart or income
* Client can request finance on residual amount
* Another option is financial rental: finance company agrees to buy vehicle back at certain time and price. Benefit is that VAT is charge on repayment not on total value of vehicle.

For client that is not self employed and does not derive income from the vehicle:

\* Required to pay a deposit (Usually 10%)
* Monthly installments can't differ by more than 10% one month to next

**Settling a finance agreement**

* May be in clients best interest to sell or settle the finance agreement
* Request a settlement figure from the finance company - informs company of intention to settle
* Paying the `balance owing` on the statement is bad because that includes interest for the full period. The settlemtn figure would be less. 
* Don't just pay the settlement amount as company may treat it as payment advance and reduces your saving

### Long-term financing

The largest purchases usually

**Costs**

Property transfer costs:

\* Transfer duty - transfer of title depends on value of property
* Conveyancer's fees
* Deeds office registry fee
* Sundries

Bond registration costs:

\* Conveyancer's fees - get cond registered
* Deeds office registry fee - registration of mortgage bond
* Sundries

Mortgage bond costs:

\* Mortgage bond initiation fee
* Admin fee
* Homeowners insurance
* Additional life insurance - a life policy to cover the bond amount

Other costs:

\* Municipal rates and taxes
* Sectional title levies - levy instead of rates. Cover rates, maintenance costs and upkeep of common areas
* Service connections - Charge for new connections
* Service deposits - 3 month depsots for water, electricity and telephones
* Agents commission - 5 - 7.5%
* Certificates - electricity and pest control paid by seller
* VAT - 15%
* Occupational rent or interest - if you stay early in the house

**Mortgage bond finance**

* Granted over a long period of time 20 - 30 years.
* Limited by gross income, it usually can;t exceed 30% the gross.
* Varaible rates of interest - when prime changes
* Fixed interest or capped - usually a slighly higher rate

**Guidelines**

What info is needed:

\* Size of the bond qualified for
* Amount of deposit required
* Best interest rates must be established
* Establish what costs can be included in bond - bond registration or transfer fees
* Estimate of repayments

**Cost of credit**

* Important to establish how frequent the interest is calculated - annually, half-yearly or quarterly.
* Establish the effective (or actual rate) interest

### Repayment of Debt vs Investing Surplus Funds

* Minimum Investment - Any surplus funds should be used to pay off debt
* Return - If you can get a higher return than the rate on the debt. By paying off a debt incurring interest of 14% the client is effectively earning 14%
* Tax considerations - Use the after tax comparison
* Risk - Limited risk of paying off debt
* Liquidity - Reducing liquid funds at cleint's disposal
* Managment - No management or admin costs

# The Time Value of Money

## Future Value of a Single Lump Sum

* PV - Present Value
* FV - Future Value
* PMT - recurring payment
* Compund Interest factor: (1 + i)^n

The formula for a single capital investment:

FV = PV(1 + i)^n

### The direction of Cash Flow

* Money that leaves your pocket is negative
* Money that you receive is positive

A R1000 (PV) investment is a negative amount as it leaves his pocket.
The amount he receives on maturity R1331 (FV) is positive

From the point of view of the bank, the R1000 (PV) received is positive and the R1331 (FV) is negative.

### Calculating FV where interest is compounded more than once per annum

* Divide the nominal rate by the number of times a year the interest is compounded
* Multiple the term by the number of times interst is compounded

## Recurring Payments (Annuities)

A recurring payment is shortened to `PMT`

The present value of an annuity.
The purchasing power of your money decreases in the future.

The present value applies a formula for measuring the current value of a stream of equal payments at the end of future payments. This is called `discounting`.

When is the present value of an annuity used? When a court settlement entitles the recipient to R2000 for 30 years.
The receiving party opts to receive a single cash payment instead of over time.
The present value will be calculated which will be less than the total of future payments because of discounting.

### Future Value of an Annuity

If the payments are made in arrears:

    FV = PMT * ((1 + r)^n -1)/r)

if the payments are made in advance:

    FV = (1 + r) * PMT * ((1 + r)^n -1)/r)

When we talk about the present value we are talking about the equivalent present day monetary value to a given period stream of payments.
So today putting R8919.56 in the bank is equivalent of investing R1500 each year for 10 years.
Therefore compounding the present day value will give you the future value.

So this shows 2 ways of calculating the Future value.
* Calculate it directly
* First calculate the PV and then compound it over the period to get the future value

### Present Value of an annuity

If the payments are made in arrears:

    PV = PMT * (1 - (1 + r)^-n / r)

If payments are made in advance:

    PV = PMT + PMT * (1 - (1 + r)^(-n-1) / r)

## Amortisation and Calculation of Loan installments

* Use the reducing balance method.
* When a loan is repayed it consists of capital repayment and interest charged.
* The first installment will have a high interest content and low capital repayment amount. This trend to the last installment which has a low interest amount and high capital amount repayment.

You can use numpy functions [`np.pmt`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.pmt.html), [`np.ppmt`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ppmt.html) and [`np.ipmt`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ipmt.html) to work out the period payments, principal amount and interest amount each.

If the interest rate changes or something else changes during the process

1. determine the outstanding balance of the loan at that point
2. treat the outstanding balance as the new loan repayable over the outstanding period and then calcualte the new monthly installments

## The Present value of an Escalating Annuity

* Annuity increases by a fixed percentage every year
* This is called the escalation rate

Formula to calculate rate at which pmt is discounted:

    (((1 + i/ (1 + e)) - 1) * 100

* `i` is the `rate`
* `e` is the `escalation rate`

> resultant rate - rate inclusive of principal amount eg: 12% => 1.12

Use this resultant rate in the calculation of the present value to get the amount

## The Future value of an escalting annuity

1. Calculate the resultant rate
2. Calculate the present value
3. Use compound interest to calculate the future value

### Example: Required Escalation rate

What is the required escalation rate for requirements:

Future value wanted: R33391.75
Years = 10
Payments per year = 1
Rate = 15% per annum
First payment = R1000

**Step 1**

Calculate the present value of R33391.75

    In [19]: np.pv(0.15, 10, pmt=0, fv=33391.75)
    Out[19]: -8253.929910644814

    R8253.92

**Step 2**

Calculate the resultant rate:

    In [21]: np.rate(10, -1000, 8253.93, 0, when=1)
    Out[21]: 0.04545455285667707

**Step 3**

The interest is 15% so we can derive the escalation rate using the formula:

    resultant_rate = (((1 + i/ (1 + e)) - 1) * 100

Therefore:

    4.5454 = (((1 + 0.15/ (1 + e)) - 1) * 100

    0.045454 = (1.15 / 1 + e) - 1

    1.045454 = 1.15 / 1 + e

    1.045454 + 1.045454e = 1.15

    1.045454e = 0.104546

    e ~= 0.1000

Therefore each year the amount should increase by 10%

Source: The South African Financial Planning Handbook (2018)

## Example: Required amount to invest for given escalation rate

John needs R50000 in 10 years time. He earns 15% interest. He is willing to escalate his investment by 10% per annum.
What is the amount he must invest on the beginning of year 1.

**Step 1: Calculate the PV with FV as the base** 

    In [22]: np.pv(0.15, 10, pmt=0, fv=50000)
    Out[22]: -12359.235306093293

**Step 2: Calculate the resultant rate**

    resultant_rate = (((1 + i/ (1 + e)) - 1) * 100
    resultant_rate = (((1 + 0.15/ (1 + 0.10)) - 1) * 100
    resultant_rate = (1.15/1.10 - 1) * 100
    resultant_rate = 4.54545454.

**Step 3: Determine the first payment**

    In [25]: np.pmt(0.045454545454, 10, 12359.23, when=1)
    Out[25]: -1497.375145921585

Therefore the first annual installment must be R1497.37

## Effective Rate of Return

Compound interest can be referred to as interest on interest

Bank A lets you invest at 15%, interest accumulates once a year.
Investing R100 gives you R115 at the end of the year.

The nominal and effective interest rates are the same: 15%

Bank B lets you invest at 15%, interest accumulates monthly.
Investing R100 gives you R116.08.

The effective rate is 16.08%, the nominal rate is 15%.

## Internal Rate of Return

Is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows from a particular project equal to 0.
A higher Internal rate of return is more desirable. It can be used to rank and compare several investment prospects.

**Step 1: Calculate the cash flow for each period**

Remember paying into an investment is negative, getting paid out is positive.

For example:

A client makes an investment of R100000 into QWERTY. He expects the following cash flows over the next 5 years:

year 1: 20000
year 2: 25000
year 3: 24000
year 4: 35000
year 5: 39000

    In [3]: np.irr([-100000, 20000, 25000, 24000, 35000, 39000])
    Out[3]: 0.11726662568720658

The internal rate of return is `0.11727`...`11.72%` which is higher than the 10% desired rate of return.

## Net present value

The present value of future cash flows.

Robert invested different amounts each year and received R700 after 6 years. If the interest rate is 8% what is the net present value of the investment:

year 1: 100
year 2: 150
year 3: 90
year 4: 105
year 5: 20
year 6: 30

    In [9]: np.npv(0.08, [-100, -150, -90, -105, -20, -30, 700])
    Out[9]: 6.598877828064417

### Examples

#### Payments towards capital and interest

My Viljoen buys a flat and gets a R50000 bond. THe bond repayments are R573.35 at the end of each month. The interest rate is 13.35% and the term is 25 years.

Calculate the interest and capital repayments during the first year of repayment:

    In [23]: sum(np.ipmt(0.1325/12, range(12), 25 * 12, 50000, when=0))
    Out[23]: -6611.8796465517225

    In [24]: sum(np.ppmt(0.1325/12, range(12), 25 * 12, 50000, when=0))
    Out[24]: -268.3229232057447

Interest paid is R6611.88
Balance paid is R268.32

The total is 573.35 * 12 = 6880.2 == 6611.88 + 268.32 = 6880.2

Remaining balance is: 50000 - 268.32 = R49731.68

#### Effective after tax rate

Jansen wins R250000. She purchases a voluntary annuity for 30 years, providing an income of R2350 per month in advance.
What is the effective after tax interest rate if the marginal ta rate is 43% and capital portion of the annuity is 40%.

Only 60% is taxable, therefore: 0.6 * 0.43 * 2350 = R606.3

The after tax annuity is: 2350 - 606.3 = 1743.7

Now plug it in to get the rate **for a period (in this case a month)**

    In [45]: rate = np.rate(360, -1743.7, 250000, 0, when=1)
    In [48]: rate
    Out[48]: 0.006282192846926178

This is the amount of interest for each month. Multiply by 12 to get the annual effective figure:

    In [49]: rate * 12
    Out[49]: 0.07538631416311414

#### Calculate rate required

At what rate should an investor invest R12000 to receive R18000 in 2.5 years if compounded monthly:

    In [53]: np.rate(2.5 * 12, 0, -12000, 18000)
    Out[53]: 0.013607250893419872

This gives you the monthly rate of interest, we need the interest for the 12 months:

    In [54]: np.rate(2.5 * 12, 0, -12000, 18000) * 12
    Out[54]: 0.16328701072103846

Therefore the interest needed is 16.32%

#### Calculate present value (original value)

Driver bought a second-hand vehicle, after 5 years his total payment to the bank amounted to R104996 including interest at 22% per annum, compounded monthly. What was the original price of the car?

    In [56]: np.pv(0.22 / 12, 5 * 12, 1749.94, when=0)
    Out[56]: -63360.207591073646

#### Important when using ppmt and ipmt

The `per` variable needs to start at 1 and end at 1 + end period.

So for 24 months == range(1, 25)

Also make sure you be explicit about `when=1`

# 9. Risk Management

Risk - A conidtion where a possibility of adverse deviation from a desired outcome that is expected or hoped for

Important to adress all risks appropriately by minimising and mitigating in a financially viable way

Risks:

\* Family risk - loss of income, assets through illness, injury, premature death, loss or damage to property
* Loss of income - most common finnancial risk
* Business risks - death of key employee
* Property risk - fire, theft and mischief
* liability risk - held legally responsible for injury or damage to another
* investment risk - risk of underlying investment devaluing

1. Gather info and objectives of client - future goals, families, working conditions, responsibilties, agreements, businesses, liabilities, health and finances
2. Identify risk management objectives - Write down a risk inventory or all possible risks. Recommednations must be consistent with the overall financial plan.
3. Analyse and evaluate the risks - class them critical, important and unimportant
4. Develop a risk management plan

## Developing a Risk Management Plan

Methods:

\* Risk avoidance - do not participate in the activity (avoid rugby injury by not playing rugby)
* Risk reduction - decrease chance of risk. Regular exercise and not smoking for health risks. Installation of an alarm and burgalar bars to reduce theft.
* Risk transfer - Death or loss of an asset can ruin a client or their family financially. Entering into an insurance contract is risk transfer.
* Risk retention - Choice to carry the risk - accept it and be responsible for it. "Self-insurance" and usually applies to smaller risks.

Types of insurance contracts:

\* Life insurance (long term)
* disability insurance
* medical aid / scheme (insurance)
* motor car insurance (shrot term)
* short-term housing etc...

## Implementing the plan

Implement and regularly review

# 10. Principles of Insurance

Important for financial planners to understand insurance law and llaws governing insurance products and contracts

Insurance - means of transferring financial risk

* spreading amongst many people
* shifting from an individual to a group
* insurer agrees to take over the risk for a premium

## Insurance law

* public insurance law - statutory (related to loaws and statutes) regulations, insurance tax law, statutory insurance schemes and consumer protection
* private insurance law - law of insurance intermediaries

### Sources

* Common law - Roman-dutch. Development in insurance law by the courts
* Legislation - Long-term insurance act 52 of 1998, short term insurance act 53 of 1998, FAIS ACt
* Constitutional bill of rights - Supreme law of South Africa

## Insurance Contract

Elements of the contract
* Undertaking of insured to pay a premium
* obligation of the insurer to compensate for a loss
* the risk being insured against
* insurable interest

## Parties

**Insurer**

* In South Africa it is not legal for the same company to do both types of insurance
* Must be registered with the FSB

**Insured**

* Policy holder - person entitled to the policy benefits under the long-term policy
* Life insured - person whose life, ability or health the policy relates

The policyholder is responsible for the life insured lack of disclosure

**Third party**

* cession
* noting of interest
* beneficiary of policy
* insolvency of insurer

> Indemnify - secure against
> Patrimonial - inherited from mother / father

Something is non-patrimonial if it cannot be inherited - ie. death, illness and loss of a limb

### Indemnity Insurance 

* Object must be of a patrimonial nature (can be inherited) - property, liability to third party and loss of occupation
* Compensation for actual cost of loss - restore to same position ( no profit and no loss)
* Limited interest (a maximum value)
* Must be insured at time of loss

### Capital insurance

* Object must be non-partimonial (cannot be inherited) - loss of limb, death of family member
* Monetary compensation regardless of financial loss
* unlimited interest in own or spuses's life. Limited interest for other family members and debtors.
* Must exist at time of taking out the contract

## Indemnity

* The amount to be paid is ascertained.
* a deducation can be made on the "deducation new for old" method
* Insurance based on replacement (new) value has no deducation
* Some include an `excess` clause - the insured bears a proportion of a certain amount of every loss

### Over-Insurance

An insured will not be able to recover more than the indemnity value. IE. if you insure to a max of R1000000, something only worth R800000 you only get R800000.

### Double Insurance

* Insuring the same interest and same risk with two or more insurers. Not allowed in medical schemes.
* No advantage to this

### Under-insurance

A house worth R600000 is insured for R400000.

    (value_insured / value_at_risk) * loss_incurred

    (160000/200000) * 25000 = 20000

### Replacement and repair

* Can choose to repair an item
* insurer cannot change mind

### Subrogation

Example: You part your outside your house and a bus collides with it. The bus takes responsibility.
On your comprehensive policy, the insurer paid R7500 to you.
The right to claim the R7500 from the bus company has been subroged (transferred) to the insurer.
The right of subrogation exists between the insurer and insured (not between the insurer and third party)

## Insurable interest

Insurable interest is the object of insurance: whether a physical objet or the financial loss arising from death
In capital insurance, the insurable interest msudt be present at the time of start of contract.
Example: business partners take out life insurance. If they break up in the future it does not invalidate the the cover held.

In indemnity insurance if an object has been damaged, stolen or sold at the time of the loss it will not be covered.

## Beneficiary Nominations

Beneficiary - person nominated by policy or policyholder to claim the proceeds of the policy. A nominal of proceeds.

_Cessation, beneficiaries, revocation of nomination is all in the book_

## Long-Term Insurance

Types of policies:

\* Assistance policy - life policy where benefit / amount of premum in return for an annuity does not exceed R10000 (or R30000)
* Disability policy - contract where benefits are paid on a disability event
* Fund Policy - contract for the purpose of funding (a medical scheme, provident fund or retirement annuity)
* Health policy - benefits on a health event
* Life policy - benefits or annuity in teh case of a life event (life begins, continues, ends)
* Sinking fund policy - one or more sums of money at a fixed or determinable future date

_alot more policy related stuff in the book_

#### Tax rate

* taxable income derived from a long-term insurance business is subject to 30%.
* Company / corporate policyholders are taxed at the corporate rate of 28%.
* Income from an untaxed policyholder is exempt.

## Short-Term Insurance

Typres of policies:

\* Engineering policy - relating to vehicles, erection of buildings and installation of machinery
* Gaurantee policy - failure of person to discharge an obligation
* Liability policy
* Miscellaneous policy
* Motor policy
* Accident and health policy
* Property policy
* Transportation policy

## Motor Insurance

* Road accident fund - legal liability for death or injury caused by the insured motor vehicle
* Balance of third party - damage to other person's property
* Balance of third party, fire and theft - third-party plus damage by fire and theft
* Comprehensive - Third-party, fire and theft plus accidental loss or damage to insured vehicle

# 11. Healthcare

* The first medical scheme was set up by De Beers Consolidated Mines in 1889.
* As costs increased, medical schemes were only entitle to vary the member's contributins based on their income and number of dependents.
* In 1989 the ability to differentiate contribution rates and risk rate was introduced
* Allowed schemes to cherry-pick
* In 1993, deregulation went further where minimum benefits were removed, enabling schemes to limit and exclude cover for procedures
* Medical scheme contributions rose steeply, and growth of members slowed.
* In 1999, no open medical scheme admitted anyone over 55 years old and all schemes had life-time exclusions for pre-existing conditions
* In 1999 (Medical Schemes Act 131 of 1998) ended the period of risk rating.
* NHI (National Helath Insurance) - universal healthcare cover providing the same quality of healthcare regardless of income, social status or residency.

Terms:

\* National Health Insurance (NHI) - Universal healthcare to both contributors and those who cannot afford to
* Social Health Insurance (SHI) - Healthcare only to those who can afford to contribute. Private sector provides for contributors, public sector for those that cannot.
* National Health Service (NHS) - Certain standard of healthcare funded by tax payers at the point of service. State is both purchaser and provider.

### Medical Scheme Act 131 of 1998

**Open access or open enrollment**

* Medical schemes have to admit anyone who applies for membership
* Only protection to poor risks is waiting periods and late joiner penalties

**Community Rating**

* All members pay the same contributions
* Members cannot be made to pay more based on age, sex, state of health or other grounds
* Only income and number of dependants can be used
* Younger members subsidise medical expenses of older beneficiaries
* Late joiner penalties is only protection for late joiners
* Discounted contributions to certain providers for using certain healthcare providers (eg. Discovery Delta)
* Scheme can charge different rates for child dependents
* Claims costs are lower for children hence a lower contribution is requried to provide them with cover

**Minimum Benefits**
* PMB - Prescribed minimum benefits
* 300 PMB's for emergency medical conditions and 27 common chronic conditions
* PMB's should follow the predominant hospital practice
* Schemes formulary - Chronic medicine benefits can insist that the members are treated with medicines approved by the scheme
* The scheme's formulary must be made available on request

### Demarcation between medical scheme and insurance products

* CMS (Council for medical schemes) and the Department of Health do not want insurance products to undermine medical schemes. Ie. Younger, healthier individuals paying cheaper premiums.
* Medical schemes need the young and healthy to subsidise the old and unhealthy
* Insurance providers are poorly regulated
* Discriminate against the elderly (rightly so)
* Insurance policies make more money available to healthcare suppliers and therefore can sustain higher charges having a negative impact on medical schemes.

Guidelines on key differences:

\* Medical scheme pays a member's actual medical expenses, Insurance policy pays a benefit that can be unrelated to medical cost
* Benefit pay out must be inline with sum for policyholder is insured

Policy Benefit provided by medical insurance:

\* premiums according to fiancial risk
* Discriminate (good discrimination) based on age, sex, health, medical history and smoking status
* Refuse cover to those they consider too high risk
* Not bound by minimum benefits
* Limits on premium increases
* Can pay a broker up to 20% of premiums. Cannot exceed 22.5% plus vat.
* Usually sold by listed companies aiming to make a prfit (much like medical schemes)

_Still many ongoing cases and acts in parliament_

#### Key Differences between medical scheme and health insurance

* Benefits paid - Medical scheeme can pay memeber's actual medical expenses. Health insurance offers a pre-determined amount of cover for certain health events - must be paid to insured not healthcare provider
* Period of cover - medical schemes cover is in force as long as member pays contributions. Health care policies offer cover for the term of the poliy
* Increase in premiums and cover - both increase each health. Health insurance have 12 month policies.
* Acceptance of cover - medical schemes must admit everyone, life assurers and short-term insurers can refuse cover.
* Risk rating - Medical schemes cannot risk rate members, health insurers can risk rate individuals.
* Commission and fees - Medical sceheme may pay a broker only 3% of contributins up to a maximum of R90 + VAT a month
* A broker can earn up to 20% of premiums on a short-term insurance policy, Fees may not exceed 22.5% plus VAT.
* Profit and governance - Medical schemes cannot make a profit that can be distributed to external parties. Insurers are listed companies looking to make a profit: spending 60 - 65% on claims, 12 - 18% on admin and 15 - 20% on commission.

## Regulators, Scheme Rules, Membership Requirements, Benefit Options, Miscellaneous Scheme Issues, Current and Future Developments, Choosing a Medical Scheme

_alot of content in the book_

## Choosing a Medical Scheme

### Step 1: Compile a list of medical schemes**

* Membership scheme size - bigger is often better, economies of scale, bargaining power
* Membership growth - schemes need to attract younger members. Reduction in members shows unhappiness.
* Solvency ratio - 25% of gross contributions
* Operating profit/loss
* Increases - a scheme with a higher than average increase may be in financial difficulty
* Claims ratio - amount of contributions spent on healthcare expenses. No healthcare expenses should be limited to 10% of contributions.
* Credit Rating
* Service levels - ask how quickly claims are paid, ask others of experience and ask healthcare providers

### Step 2: Establish client's needs

See what a member has spent on in the last 5 years
A member is more likely to need expensive benefits as they get older and increase number of dependants

* hospitalisation - back operation or childbirth
* specific conditions - diabetes or heart conditions
* specialised dentistry
* optical benefits

### Step 3: Matching needs to benefits offered

1. Medical benefits offered - savings account - how much and whether enough to cover. In network? where are they located
2. Annual limits and sub-limits - unlimited, or limited to a rand value or number of visits. Watch out for combinations: consultations with gp and specialists, basic and advanced dentistry and pariology and pathology. Check transplant and chemotherapy. Limits and exclusions. 
3. Rate at which benefits are covered - Reference Price List (RPL)
4. Co-payments or levies - Co payments for specialists or certain procedures not in the PMB.
5. Restirctions on access - certaino doctors, particular hospital groups, certain pharmacies, list of medical formularies.

### Step 4: Check Cost and review choices

Check for late joiner peanlty: over the age of 35, has not been a memvber of another medical scheme or has lapsed payment for 3 months.

If employer pays subsidy - remember to deduct that subsidy from the overall contribution and establish if any portion of the subsidy is taxed.

**Is the member prepared to pay the contributions for the benefits offered?** If not prepared, the levle of cover will need to be cut back.

# 12. Introduction to Investment Planning

Important to evaluate investment decisions, investment performance and investment managers. Know how clients behave under certain circumsdtances espescially in a dramatic decline in market prices.

Investment - current commitment of money for a period of time to derive future benefits.

Compensate fot:

\* postponed consumption - time value of money
* rate of inflation - maintain purchasing power
* Unvertainty - risk (higher risk should be given a higher reward)

## Real vs Financial Assets

Financial Assets - Equities, bonds, cash, derivatives and certain types of property
Real assets - tangible such as physical property, commodities and collectibles.

## Asset Classes

Group of securities that exhibit similar characteristics

* cash - liquid, low-risk investment can easily be converted to cash (money market)
* bonds - debt in an entity
* shares - ownership in a company
* property - physical property, real estate and real estate invest trusts (REIT)

## Investment Process

* Porfolio is a collectoin of investment assets
* asset allocation - choice among asset classes
* **Over the long term - asset allocation is the most important decision an investor makes**
* saving - income not spent that can be added to your portfolio
* Top down portfolio construction - starts with asset allocation

Since 1900:

\* South African equity has returned better than 12% per year
* South African bonds 6.8%
* Cash has returned 6%

This gives a real return of

* Equity: 7.3% - R1 invested is worth R3671.7
* Bonds: 1.8% - R1 invested is worth R7.78
* Cash: 1% - R1 is worth R3.14

Stocks are **far riskier** with annual returns as low as -30% and as high as 104%.
In contract government issued treasury bills are risk-free (essentially) as you know the interest rate you will earn when you buy them.

> Important to look at how fees would have affected these returns.

Security analysis is the valuation on particular securities in a portfolio

* Valuation is far more difficult for shares - depends on situation of individual firm
* Bottom up construction
* May cause hevy represenation on a certain industry

> It is often the case that it is not the plan that fails to client but the client that fails the plan

**Monitoring, adjusting and knowing you client's attitude to risk** is an essential part of the financial planner's task

* There are so many investment products it is difficult for clients to choose.
* Financial planner is focused on the client
* Asset managers are focused on security analysis and funds

It is now called **wealth management** where both tasks are undertaken together.

> Beware of conflict of interest, espescially if the owner of the asset management company is given you financial planning advice. They will usually put you in funds and positions that make them the most profit.

Wealth management process:

# 13. Investment Return and Risk

**Actual investment returns can rarely be predicted, let alone gauranteed**

* Investors want the highest expected returns with the lowest possible risk
* Time value of money, inflation and risk play a role in determining the required rate of return.
* Important to know the willingness and capacity for investors to take risk (take a big loss)

## Measuring investment returns

The headline return is misleading. It does not reflect the risk taken, impact of inflation, taxes or fees for the investor.
A study showed that a 11.24% reported nominal return actually equated to a 5.21% real return.

Performance attribution analysis must be done to determine where the return came from, hwo much risk was taken, how much of the return was through the market versus skill of the portfolio manager.

### Risk Free Rate of Return

Government borrows money by issuing treasury bills and bonds. Treasury bills have the shortest time to maturity, Government can raise taxes or print money (not in South Africa's case) to pay them.

It is virtually free of any default risk and is a benchmark.
A greater return is know an excess return arrising from more risk - the rsk premium

### Nominal Rate of Return

Gross return one earns on an investment without considering the effects of the risk taken, time value of money, inflation or taxes.

### Real rate of Return

Reflects the impact of inflation in purchasing power terms.
The RRFR - Real Risk Free Rate accounts for the time value of money assuming no inflation and no investment risk.

    real_rate = [(1 + nominal_rate) / (1 + inflation_rate)] - 1

### Required Rate of Return

Most fundemental and relevant rate - important yet diificult to accurately determine.

    required_return_rate = real_risk_free_rate + expected_inflation + default_risk_premium + liquidity_premium + maturity_risk_premium

Does not account for **risk capacity** and **risk tolerance**

Another way of looking at required rate is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) - what is that?

### Holding Period Return

* Total return for a specified period over which an investment is held
* Investors prefer this as a percentage on an annualised basis

    HPR = (end_value - begin_value + dividends_received) / begin_value

To caluclate annulised, first calculate HPR then use:

    Annual_HPR = [(1 + HPR)^1/n - 1] * 100

### Expected Rate of Return

An estimate

1. Analyse various expected returns
2. Analyse the likelihood of various scenarios playing out

    Expected_return = propability_of_return * possible_return

* Boom - Probability of return: 40% - Possible return: 30%
* Normal - Probability of return: 20% - Possible return: 15%
* Recession - Probability of return: 40% - Possible return: -10%

    return = (0.4 * 0.3) + (0.2 * 0.15) + (0.4 * -0.1)
    return = 0.1188 == 11.88%

### Real Return after Tax

Money market account giving 8.5%, fully taxable at your 45% marginal rate.

    real_return = return * (1 - tax_rate)
    real_return = 8.5% * (1 - 0.45)
    real_return = 4.675%


What before tax rate is needed to get 8.5% return:

    8.5% = required_return * (1 - 0.45)
    required_return = 8.5% / 0.55
    required_return = 15.45%

With 10% on a 5-year fixed deposit and a marginal tax rate of 45% and interest exemption of R23500.
The before tax return is R100000.

    tax_free_return_percentage = exemption_amount / before_tax_return 
    tax_free_return_percentage = 23800 / 100000 =  0.238

    # portion of the 10% yield that is taxable
    taxable_yield = rate_given - (rate_given * tax_free_percentage)
    taxable_yield = 0.1 - (0.1 * 0.238)
    taxable_yield = 0.0762
    tax_free_yield = 1 - 0.0762 = 0.0238

    after_tax_yield = (tax_free_return_percentage * (1 - tax_rate)) + tax_free_return_percentage
    after_tax_yield = 0.0762 * (1 - 0.45) + 0.0238
    after_tax_yield = 0.06571 == 6.571%

> Remember to use the NPV (Net present value) and IRR (Internal rate of return)

## Investment Risk

Risk is uncertainty that an investment will earn its expected rate of return

One way to reduce risk is to diversify across asset classes. **This does not eliminate risk but does reduce the risk of losing everything at once**

### Inflation Risk

* Purchasing power risk - risk of an investment losing purchasing power over time.
* Important when looking at interest rate sensitive securities like bonds
* A shortcut to calculate the time it takes for purchasing power to half is: 72 / (rate * 100)
* At 12% inflation: 72/12 = 6 years for purchasing power of capital to half
* At 6% inflation: 72/6 = 12 years for purchasing power of capital to half
* Investors with a long-term view: inflation poses as great a threat as stock market volatility. THerefore the portfolio should be more heavily weighted towards equities - even for a more conservative risk profile.
* Investors with a short-term view: share price volatility poses a greater threat than inflation, therefore a portfolio should be more heavily weighted towards cash and short-term deposits.

* **Interest rate risk** - financial and real assets are affected by unexpected or expected changes in interest rate
* **Market risk** - Day-to-day fluctuations in an asset's price also referred to as volatility
* **Business risk** - Uncertainty of cash flows caused by the nature of a company
* **Financial risk** - uncertainty with how a business finances as investment
* **Liquidity risk** - The ability to convert the value of an asset into cash at a value close to its market value. Shares of small cap companies have high liquidity risk as they are thinly traded. As opposed to treasury bills that are very liquid.
* **reinvestment risk** - If interest rates rise, investors in short term instruments can profitable reinvest at higher rates and avoid capital value losses associated with longer term investments.However if interest rates fall, short term instrument owners will have to reinvest at lower rates.
* **country risk** - political risk
* **currency risk** - exchange-rate risk, uncertainty of returns for a foreign currency.
* **Systematic risk** - large range of assets - also called market risk or non-diversifiable risk
* **Unsystematic risk** - Asset specific - single or small grou pof asset - risk. It is eliminated by diversification.

## Measuring Risk

### Standard Deviation

How far from the expected return the realised return falls under normal circumstances

* Volatility - amount of uncertainty about the size of changes in a securities value. The price of a securtity with high volatility can change in a relatively short period in either direction.

A standard deviation of 20% around a mean return of 12% essentially means:

\* out of a number of years - About 68% of years, the return will fall within 12% + 1 standard deviation and 12% - 1 standard deviation

The formula is the sum of the difference between the expected return and actual squared, multipled by the probability of that occuring. All of that square rooted.

* variance is the standard deviation squared.
* standard deviation is the variance square rooted.

caluclating the standard deviation of returns:

1. Calculate the mean
2. determine the square deviations from the mean - giving the variance
3. square root the variance

### Coefficient of Variance

The ratio of the standard deviation to the means. Useful for comparing the degree of variation from one data series to another even if the means are dramatically different.

    coefficient_of_variation = standard_deviation / expected_return

Lower the standard deviation to the means return, the better your risk-return trade-off. The higher the coefficient of variation, the higher the risk.

### Beta (Beta Coefficient)

* The measure of volatility of a security or portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole.
* The tendency of a security's return to respond to swings in the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price will move with the market.
* Greater than 1 means the moves are more volatile than the market.
* Less than 1, means less volatile than the market.
* For example utility stocks have beta's of less than 1, but Nasdaq high-text stocks have greater than 1 meaning they give a higher rate of return compared to the market but greater risk on downturns.
* Portfolios also have Betas and can be used to compare the volatility of a portfolio in comparison to the market - more aggressive or defensive

### Sharpe Ratio

Performance earned in excess of the risk-free return compared to the risk taken.
What is the risk free rate? Usually obtained from treasury bills with no default risk

    sharpe_ratio = (portfolio_return - risk_free_rate) / std_deviation

* Clearly, if an investor is taking risk they should anticipate a higher return than they could get in an investment that has no risk
* Does the additional return earned justify the additional risk taken

### Treynor ratio

Similar to the sharpse ratio but uses the Beta to determine the risk instead of standard deviation

    treynor_ratio = (portfolio_return - risk_free_rate) / portfolio_beta

* Good for comparing the performance of a portfolio against the asset class that the portfolio is drawn from
* Treynor consider's only market risk, Sharpe considers all risk

### Jenen's Alpha

* The measurement of portfolio manager skill
* Measured returns and risk
* The difference in performance that would have been expected from a comparable portfolio
* A positive value indicates that the fund manager has "beat the market"

> A risk-adjusted performance measure that represents the average return on a portfolio over and above that predicted by the capital asset pricing mdoel (CAPM) given the portfolio's beta and average market return.

    jensens_alpha = rate_of_return - [risk_free_rate + beta_of_portfolio(rate_of_return_market - risk_free_rate)]

## Risk and the individual investor

Investor constraints are very important and impact the risk or return objectives.

### Investment Constraints

#### Time Horizon

* When will the client need to draw on his capital.
* Research shows that while equities are very volatile over short periods, volatility declines with the passage of time.
* Impacts on the ability and willingness of an investor to tolerate risk
* Reseach suggest's that as holding period increases, the risk is reduced.
* A person who retires at 65 is likely to live for another 15 to 25 years

> In Seigel's research on efficient portfolios (most returns) What is thought-provoking about this is that it suggests that even conservative investors who take a five-year view should be holding 38.7% of their portfolio in shares and a moderate investor 61.6%

#### Liquidity Requirements

* Ability to convert the investment into cash
* Price or cost at which it can be liquidated
* It is advisable for a client to have a sum of money available as an emergency fund
* Specific capital requirements, such as a overseas trip, needs a specific budget and appropriate investment

#### Tax Considerations

* income tax, cpaital gains tax, dividends tax, interest income tax
* use of tax concessions available

#### Unique circumstances

* religious - avoid tabacco and gambling

### Investment Objectives

#### Risk Objectives

* Risk measurment - Standard deviation or Beta

Risk tolerance is not quantifiable but risk objective's are:

\* A "Lower than average risk tolernce" may mean a loss of total value not to exceed x% or annual volatility to not exceed y%
* absolute risk objectives - relating to total returns - at least a real return of 1% over inflation
* relative risk objectives - not be less than the JSE All Share Index over a 12 month period

**Risk tolerance and risk capacity**

* risk tolerance - willingness to take risk, emotional tolerance for volatility, uncertainty and taking a loss
* risk capacity - abiltiy to take risk, the financial capacity to withstand market losses

If risk tolerance exceeds risk capacity, the lower of the 2 should prevail.
* If a client is willing to take more risk but due to the financial circumstances, shouldn't.
* A client can take lots of risk but does not like taking a loss, things should be more conservative.

#### Return Objectives

* How are returns measured? percentage, benchmar, nominal, real, pre-tax, post-tax
* How much return does an investor want? 
* How much return does the investor need? required return
* Specific return objectives - 5% after-tax

> An investor's return objective should be consistent with the investor's risk objective

* Mandate - set of instructions detailing the investment manager's task and how his performance will be evaluated

#### Risk profiling

There are risk profiling services available
* conservative, moderate and aggressive

A financial planner could recommend a multi-manager product such as a wrap fund or structured fund tailored towards a specific risk profile

#### Conservative Investor

* Long term capital preservation
* Cash: 30%, Bonds: 50%, Equities: 20%

#### Moderate Investor

* Looking for income and growth
* Less volatile than the market as a whole
* Cash: 10%, Bonds: 35%, Equities: 55%

#### Aggressive Investor

* High level of growth
* Willing to endure a measure of uncertainty to achieve the goal
* cash: 5%, Bonds: 10%, Equities: 85%

**It is important to know that a clien's tolerance for risk is actually lower than the client thinks**

# 13. Investment Theory

## Efficient Market Hypothesis

* Thousands searching for price anomalies in the market.
* Any mispricings are arbitraged out of the market. 
* The price is the reflation of collective wisdom
* New information is quickly and efficiently taken up in the price
* Eugene Fama argued that it was impossible to beat the market

### Versions of EMH (Efficient Market Hypothesis)

* Weak form - share prices already reflect all the information dervied from trading data, prices, volume or short interest
* Semi-strong form - All info regarding prospects of the firm are already in the price
* Strong form - All information even internal info is reflected in the price

> The result was the birth of index funds

### Implications of the EMH for investors

If you believe in the Efficient market hypothesis:

* Investor whould split between risk free and market.
* Instead of worrying about buying the right investment, worry about getting the risk profile right.
* It is futile to try and beat the market as all info is already known
* Getting a higher return than market is most probably because of greater risk taking
* Stuying public information will not allow investors to gain abnormal returns
* New information would change intrinsic value and be absorbed almost immediately my the market
* rely on a passive management strategy and pay as little as possible for it - such as an index fund
* Research suggests that most investment managers do not beat the averages and those who do, tend to do so on an inconsistent basis.

If you don't belive it:

\* Active managers believe their ability to recognise mispricings give them an advantage
* Make various kinds of bets
* Claim better sources of information

## Portfolio Selection and Markowitz Diversification

* Way to create efficient portfolios
* The average risk of a portfolio is made up of the covariance of one security to another
* The important thing is how the investments relate to each other
* Combining investments that are not perfectly correlated can reduce risk without sacrificing return
* A practical example: determines the number of shares an investor should hold in a portfolio to ensure that the portfolio is no more risky than the market as a whole
* You can plot a client indifference curve which represent the investor's preference for risk and return
* Then test them against portfolios risk return scatter plot


**Allows investor to identify optimal portfolio from an almost infinite number of possible portfolios**

1. Investor specifies a set of securities
2. The securities are analysed and the expected returns, variances and covariances are found.
3. The efficient set is determined using the securities selected and assumptions made. The portfolios forming tje efficient set are then calculated.

## CAPM - Capital Asset Pricing Model

* Developed in 1963 by William Sharpe
* A practical way to select share portfolios
* Instead of Markowitz's co-variance, only the relationship between each security and the dominant factor is used
* Sharpe argued that the dominant factor was how the market performed as a whole
* what the hell is the _dominant_ factor?

### Capital market line

Instead of buying a tailor-made portfolio, the investor buys the market in different amounts depending on his appetite for risk.

> Sharpe ratio - Reward per unit of risk taken is the difference between market return less risk-free rate of interest divided by the unit of risk taken (standard deviation of the capital market line)

**In Capital Asset Pricing Model, all investors hold the same portfolio, with differing amounts of money invested**

> The idea of creating a portfolio of less risky shares does not find favour with this theory. In direct contrast to the thoughts of [Benjamin Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Graham), the father of value investing and role model of Warren Buffett, who felt that risk could be reduced by the careful analysis and selection of a portfolio of shares.

### Securities market line

* If market as a whole moves in a particular direction, most shares will move in the same direction but at difference rates.
* The Beta (B) co-efficient indicates the security's return changes systematically with changes in the market's return
* A beta greater than one indicates that the security has above average risk
* Expected return:
    * earn at least risk-free rate
    * equities are more risky than risk free investments and should earn an equity premium
    * affected by specific risk of equity
* If a security earns more than expected from the beta, the excess is called the Alpha (a)
* The Capital Asset Pricing Model belives risk can be reduced by diversification
* A stage is reached where risk cannot be reduced anymore within an asset class.
* Risk left is non-diversifiable or systematic risk
* The investor receives no reward for taking on diversifiable or non-systematic risk

    return = risk_free_rate + beta * (average_return_equities - risk_free_rate)

### Comments

* CAPM is difficult to prove and disprove
* It assumes an efficient portfolio, the market portfolio
* Interesting **how few portfolio managers are actually able to beat the market**
* Research shows no association between beta and returns
* Modern portfolio maangement accepts that investors act rationally. In reality most investors get lower returns than the markets they invest in because they react irrationally to political and economic noise
* Markets are not stable or self-regulating
* Markets do not follow the normal (gaussian) distribution curve, that is why we have fat tails.
* It is a theoretical starting point (not a hard and fast model)

### Arbitrage Pricing Theory

* Main factor affecting return is risk. It is also difficult to prove or disprove empirically.
* Capital asset pricing model assumes investors are risk averse
* Assumes:
    * Portfolio should earn risk-free rates of return
    * Depends on how senstive it is to certain factod and the amounts
    * Each share has its own idiosyncratic risk
* Need a big database and complex statistic analysis

    return = risk_free_return + B1(factor_1) + B2(factor_2) + B3(factor_3)

### Random Walk

* French Mathematician - Louis Bachelier
* Probability of prices going up is the same as down
* Expectation of the speculation is therefore 0

### Microeconomics

* Focuses on individual decision units and their interactions
* Individuals, households and businesses
* Transactions
* Supply and demand
* Firms trying to maximise profits within boundaries of constraints

## Economy and National Accounts

### Basic model of the Economy

* It is the flow of goods and services between producers and consumers.
* Producers sell goods to consumers
* Consumers pay for goods by selling their labour
* Producers pay consumers for their labour

Four main sectors in an economy:
1. Households
2. Firms
3. Government
4. Foreign Sector

### National Accounts

Measurements about the state and performance of the economy - done by StatsSA and SARB

#### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

* Measure of economic activity - all goods and services produced - within that economy in a specific period.
* Annually or quarterly
* Nominal GDP - Measured in terms of current prices
* Real GDP - Takes into account the impact of price variations by measuring GDP at constant prices
* Most important indicator of the economy
* Output of foerign owned firms is included, income of locally owned foreign firms (Naspers) are excluded
* GDP = C (Household spending) + I (Company spending on capital goods) + G (Gov spending) + [X ( Spending by foreigners on SA goods) - M (Spending by South Africans on Imported goods)]

#### Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE)

* Total value of spending on goods and services within a country
* Private expenditure + Governement expenditure
* GDE = GDP - X (Exports) + M (Imports)
* GDE > GDP = More exports than imoprts
* GDE < GDP = More imports than exports
* Balance of payments

#### Gross National Income

* A political term - instead of geographic term of GDP
* All income by citizens and permanent residents - irrespective of where production occurs
* GNI = GDP - primary income payments + primary income receipts
* GNI = GDP - Net primary income

### Balance of Payments

* Record of transactions between residents of the reporting country and the rest of the world
* Any period of sustained economic growth leads to an increased demand for imports - causing the balance of accounts going into deficit
* If inflow of foreign money does not come, interest rates have to rise to attract foreign money to balance the account.
* Which could increase foreign portfolio inflows causing the rand to appreciate - higher demand for curreny
* In turn, lowering the level of economic activity in the domestic economy
* In the 1990's South Africa was banned from imports from certain countries and therefore ran at a trade surplus. Which hampered the economy. Rapidly growing economies have a negative trade balance - which increases demand for capital goods and imports
* Insufficient inflow of foreign currency to meet demand for imports accompanies a decline in the value of the currency of the importing country.
* Foreign direct investment (into plant and machinery) is low compared to foreign financial market investment - which can be moved out on the short term.
* Withdrawal of short term capital -> leads to a run on a country's currency -> defending the rand with higher interest rates as opposed to stingent exchange controls making it harder to repatriate money.
* 5 accounts:
    * current account: exports - imports
    * capital transfer account: 
    * financial account: Internation transfers in assets and liabilities
    * unrecorded transactions
    * official reserves account

### Supply and Demand

* Supply - how much the market can offer. Quantity supplied is what producers will supply at a certain price.
* Demand - how much is desired by buyers. Quantity desired by buyers at a particular price.

#### Supply

* Higher price of a good, the more supply by producers.
* Leads to more revenue and profit.

#### Demand

* We are talking about intention and means to buy items, people must be willing and able to buy.
* Higher the price of a good, the lower the demand by buyers.

#### Equilibrium

* Supply and demand are equal
* Allocation of goods is at its most efficient
* Amount of goods supplied is the same as the amount of goods being demanded
* Real market equilibrium can only ever be reached in theory

__excess supply__ - price is set too high, demanded quantity is much lower so excess supply.
__excess demand__ - price is set too low (below equilibrium), too many consumers want the good but producers are not producing the amount demanded. So there is excess demand.

## The Business Cycle

### Expansion phase

1. economic activity low - current account surplus - demand for imports low
2. domestic companies export more
3. domestic money supply increases
4. increased money supply - interest rates decline
5. more consumer spending
6. demand increases producers expand production
7. higher wages and salaries
8. increased imports
9. Increase in prices (inflation) due to increased demand

### Contractionary phase

1. price of goods less competitive, less demand from abroad
2. imports rise, exports decrease
3. balance of payments deficit
4. money leave the country - supply of money declines
5. value of rand weakens - imports become more expensive
6. interest rates rise to attract more foreign money
7. consumers demand less - prices (inlfation) decreases

### Revival phase

1. Prices are declining or stable
2. Weak rand makes S exports attractive
3. Declining imports and rising exports - trade balance moves to surplus
4. Increase in supply of money
5. Reduces interest rates
6. demand for goods increase
7. More people employed - wages increase
8. Inflation begins

### Investing in the Business Cycle

1. Producers experience strong demand - investors unaware of the potential invest in cash and interest bearing investments which offer attractive yields instead of shares
2. Strong expansion is taking place - investors react enthusiastically
3. New entries and expansion causes overcapcity, prices and profits decline - investors become disenchanted - investor's portfolios are biased to shares and underweight in bonds
4. No new entries, demand catches up with supply - shares are completely out of favour, investors are underweight shares and overwight bonds and fixed
5. demand exceeds supply, profits increase - some investors go back into shares others continue to hold cash
6. Prices rise, increases in profits are reported - invesotrs once again get enthusiastic, unit trust sales boom and interest bearing investments fall out of favour.

> Investors that can predit the turning points in business cycle can increase their returns. Predicting such turning points is not easy.

## Fiscal and Monetary Policy

### Fiscal Policy

* Government policy on spending and taxation
* Main instrument is the **budget** - spending plans and how this spending will be funded

### Monetary policy

* Measures taken to adjust money supply and the rate of interest in an economy to maintain stable prices, full employment and economic growth

Some economists think:
1. money supply increases -> interest rates will fall
2. lower interest rates -> more investment projects become profitable
3. investment increases
4. increase in GDP

> Why observers say a decrease in interest rates is an attempt to increase GDP. Some say that this increases inflation though.

Instruments of monetary policy: **repo rate** and **open market policy** - sale or purchase of domestic financial assets (treasury bills and government securities). When it wants to increase money supply it buys government securities on the open market, to persuade market to sell securities the price of bonds have to be raised. To reduce money supply it sells bonds at a cheaper rate than the ruling price - therebuy raising effecive interest rates? How?

#### Inflation targetting

Between 3% AND 6%, arguments for:

\* keeping public informed
* provide an anchor for inflation expectations
* increased transparency
* increased accountability
* increased stability in nominal rates
* reducing inflation expectatoins
* reducing degree of money illusion
* stability in the value of money

#### Interest Rates

* The amount a borrower pays to a lender for the use of the funds borrowed
* A real interest rate = Nominal interest rate - inflation rate
* Eg. 15% mortgage rate - 8% annual inflation rate = 7% real interest rate for sake of comparing

Prospects for lower interest rates depend on:

\* maintenance or tightening of discipline in public sector finances
* slower growth in bank credit extension
* a stronger national savings effort
* improvement in current account balance of payments and level of foreign reserves
* relative strength of the currency compared to other currencies
* decline in inflation
* level of inflation and interest rates in other parts of the world

#### Interest Rate Patterns

* Vary based on the riskiness of the investment
* If demand exceeds supply, interest rates will rise. If supply exceeds demand, interest rates will decline.
* If government expenditure exceeds revenue, it has to borrow from the private sector to make up the shortfall. The higher the deficit, the greater the borrowings, the greater the interest rate.
* More investment in equipment and plant will increase demand for long term capital, increasing its interest rate.
* If interest rates overseas are high, interest rates locally need to be high to attract foreign money.

> South African investors may be prepared to hold money overseas at low interest rates if they believe that the value of the rand will decline against that currency.

Investors need to be rewarded for holding investments with different maturity dates. This is the _liquidity preference theory_

## Inflation

> Too much money chasing too few goods

* Continuous increase in prices

deflation - reduction in supply of credit and decrease in government, personal and investment spending - regarded as negative state of economy.

disinflation - slowing of the rate at which prices increase

### Effects of inflation

* Distributions effect - redistribute income and wealth from creditors (lenders) to debtors (borrowers), if the real interest rate is negative (inflation > interest rate)
* Economic effects - encourages speculative activity, discourage saving. Balance of payment problems - SA inflation greater than trading partners
* Social and political effects - price rises make people unhappy, causes tension and conflict.

### Causes of Inflation

* Cost-push - A cost of production increase without a corresponding increase in output
* Demand-pull - Increase in demand for goods and services accomadated by an increased supply of money to buy. Self-perpetuating (increased prices -> increase demand for wages -> increased demand for goods and services -> increased prices)

#### Measurement

Consumer price inflation - a basket of consumer goods and services
Producer price inflation - measures cost of production. Includes capital and intermediate goods, excludes VAT (included in CPI) and excludes services (45% of CPI)

### Why is Inflation Bad?

* Losses to savers (interest not enough to compensate for inflation)
* Losses to people with fixed incomes - purchasing power diminishes over time
* Losses to tax payers - if slary increases inline with inflation, the higher tax rate means a larger share is taken of your slary.
* Confusing price signals
* Reduced attention to productivity - wage negotiations are more focused on compensation for inflation instead of increased productivity and employment.
* Wastage of time and resources - Prices change very often then people have to focus on changing prices and watching news etc than doing their actual job
* Heightened tension and docial disruptions

> Ill-informed people claim that inflation is not bad. They argue that higher inflation will stimulate economic growth. These claims are false. It is easy and inexpensive to print more money, thereby boosting inflation; even the poorest countries do that. If this were a way to achieve economic prosperity no poor countries would remain on earth.

### How to Stop Inflation?

Freeze all prices - controls symptoms not cause

If inflation too high:
1. SARB raises repo rate
2. Banks raise lending and deposit rates
3. People buy fewer goods on credit
4. less money with shopkeepers
5. less money harder to increase wages
6. Inflation is reduced

> Lending rates must be significantly higher than the inflation rate if excessive credit growth is to be prevented

SARB can also use open market operations - buying and selling financial assets on the open market

### Exchange Rates

Exchange rate - price of one currency in terms of another currency

Direct method - amount of local currency to buy a foreign currency
Indirect method - amount of foreign currency to but 1 unit of a local currency

There is a selling rate (rate dealer will sell to you) and a buying rate (rate a dealer will buy from you)
The difference between these rates is the spread

#### Determination

* Determined by market forces - supply and demand
* SARB can intervene in the forex market by supplying dollars when large demand for foreign exchange threatens to disrupt the market
* The balnce-of-payments is the biggest determinant
* Non economic factors: political developments and rumours also affect the exchange rate

#### Spot and Future exchange rates

* Spot rate - rate for immediate delivery
* Forward rate - rate for delivery at a future date
* The forward price is usually higher or lower than spot
* Lets importers and exporters cover themselves against the risk of future changes in the spot exchange rate

The effective exchange rate is the weighted average

## Unemployment

* A person is unemployed if he or she desires employment but cannot find a job.
* Unemployed persons as a percentage of a total number of people willing and able to work
* Expanded definition includes everyone who desires employment irrespective of whether they are trying or not.

### Types

* Frictional - Workers moving from one job to another
* Structural - A mismatch between offered jobs and potential worker's education, skills, expertise and geographic location. 
* Seasonal - farming and tourism may change with the seasons
* Cyclical - Not enough aggregate demand from the business cycle

## Role of Gold

* Gold was internationally accepted as the preferred metal to back various currencies
* On 15 August 1971, Nixon announced the end of the gold standard.

## The great recession financial crisis (2008-2009)

1. Extension of credit to homeowners that could not affort the credit
2. Packaged debt sold to other investors
3. Combining poor investments into a single vehicle made it less risky
4. Individual defaulted to instituiotions, insittions defaulted to one another

> Instituitions no longer trusted individuals and each othe. leading to a liquidity crisis.

Governments and central banks became major shareholders in the big financial instituitions.

Usually the injection of liquidity into the world economies would have caused inflation. Not in this case.

Warning signs of crisis:

\* Asset price inflation
* Rising leverage and indebtedness
* Sustained current account deficits
* Slowing down in the rate of economic growth

# Yield

This is not in the book but it is an important term...**yield**

* Yield is the earnings (or cash flow) generated from an investment over time
* It is expressed in terms of a percentage of the invested amount / market value of the security

# The Money Market

* Short-term funds to borrowers from the government and the corporate sector. (short term == not eceeding 12 months)
* High liquidity, low risk

## Participants

* SARB - South African Reserve Bank
* Corporation for public deposits
* PIC - Public Investment Corporation
* IDC - Industrial Development Corporation
* Land and Agricultural Bank

## Money Market Instruments

* Treasury Bills - Short term debt issued by government, benchmark indicator of market conditions, used as liquid assets
* Call deposits - Called back on demand, Interest calculated on a daily balance and paid monthly
* Notice deposits - Period of notice must be given prior to withdrawal of funds
* Banker's acceptance
* Promissory notes
* Negotiable certificate of Deposit

## Money Market yields

* Money market for debt instruments is up to one year
* Discount instrument - sell at a discount to their face value, make a single payment on maturity and make no interest payments before maturity. The yield percentage is always higher than the discount because yield is a percentage of the purchase value (which is lower than the redemption value)
* Interest bearing instruments - quoted in nominal terms. In comparing the yield of money market instruments, always convert the yield into an effective annual rate (EAR)

### Discount Instruments

1. Calculate the yield:

    amount discounted = ( face_value * days_to_maturity * discount_rate ) / 365

2. Determine the nominal annual yield:

    NAY = ( discounted_amount / purchase_price ) * (365 / days_to_maturity )

3. Use a financial calcualtor to get the EAR. Assume the investment is continously rolled over for 1 year, the rate stays unchanged.

#### Example

Treasury bill has a face value of R1000000 with 91 days until maturity at a discount rate of 6%. What is teh Effective Annual Rate.

    amount_discounted = (1000000 * 91 * 0.06) / 365
    amount_discounted = 14958.90410958904

This is R60000 annual interest apportioned to 91 of 365 days.

The purchase price of the treasury bill is: 

    purchase_price = 1000000 - amount_discounted
    purchase_price = 985041.095890411

The nominal annual yield:

    nay = (amount_discounted / purchase_price ) * (365 / 91)
    nay = 0.06091116426545029
    nay = 6.0911%

The effective annual rate would be compounding over 1 year:

    rate = 6.2316%

### Interest Bearing Intrument

Use a financial calculator: nominal to effective

#### Conclusion

* Low risk, lower returns
* Unlikely place for individual participation due to minimum investment criteria
* Through money market funds investors can invest in codt-effective and convenient way

# The Bond Market

* Issued by governments, public corporations and companies
* From 2 to 20 years
* Offer investor a series of fixed interest payments during its life along with repayment of principal

## Capital Market

The bond market (or capital market) can be issued by the borrower directly to the lender but there is also a secondary market.

### Issuers in the Capital Markets

* Private sector - companies need funds for long-term investments (issuing shares, corporate bonds, debentures and rights issues)
* Central Government - Issue long term bonds, considered the safest investment as government can pay off loan with tax it takes from evryone else. 
* Municipalites and public corporations - (Eksdom, public utilities - Rand Water) Finance for long term expansion projects

### Role Players

* Banks - deposit takers who offer mortgage finance for housing
* Insurance companies - personal savings as insurance premiums can be used to source funds from the public sector
* stock exchange - lists new bonds

## Types of Bonds

### Coupon Bonds

* Issuer to pay the bondholder a fixed sum of money on the maturity of the bond along with constant periodic interest payments
* Convertible bonds - can convert bonds into shares of teh issuing company
* Callable bond - Grants issuer the right to repurchase the bond if interest rates decreae
* Bond with put option grants bondholders the right to sell their bonds back to the issuer at a special put price

### Zero-coupon Bonds

Discount bonds that do not pay periodic interest. Initially sold at a price below par value.

### Inflation linked bonds

* Pay interest rate that adjusts to keep track with inflation
* Contracted to vanilla bonds which pay a fixed rate for the lifetime of the bond
* Yields usually lower compared to vanilla bonds

#### Tax on inflation linked bonds

* Changes in the rate are taxable
* Coupon payments and the difference between the acquisition cost and the nominal value of a bond is defined as intrest and is taxable for income tax purposes

## Risk of Bonds

* Interest rate risk - changes in interest rates (interest rates rise, bond values fall)
* Yield curve risk - yield change by different amounts for bonds with different maturities
* Call risk - callable bond's investors may need to reinvest at lower rates (reinvestment risk)
* Credit risk - creditworthiness of a bon's issuer will deteriorate, increasing the required return and decreasing the bond's value
* Liquidity risk - sell bond lower than market value because of lack of liquidity
* Inflation risk - increases more than expected
* Volatility risk - interest rate volatility
* Sovereign risk - Changes in government attitudes and policies towards payment and serviving of debt

## Attributes of a Bond

* Principal value (face value, future value, redemption value, nominal value or par value) - Paid to the holder on the maturity date
* Market value (present value) - present value of all future cash flows of the bond, discounted at the current market rate
* Coupon rate (coupon yield, nominal yield) - fixed rate of interest the holder will receive each year
* Term to maturity - period of time until the maturity of bond

## Bond Pricing and Yields

### Calcualting the present value of a bond

* Determined by current interest rate in  country at the time
* Interest rates may vary above and below the fixed rate of the bond's lifetime
* A bond giving 15% coupon rate and current rates decrease to 13% will increase the value of the bond
* The price of a bond rises as the current market interest rate falls

#### Example

An investor invests in an Eksdom bond. Par value: R1000000. Coupon rate of 8.5% with a maturity of 5 years.
Coupon payments take place at the end of every 6 month period.

1. Work out the monthly payments:

    1000000 * 8.5% = 85000
    85000 / 2 = 42500 (biannual payments)

2. The rate (discount rate) is 8% / periods: 0.08/2 = 0.04

The future value is 1000000

    In [2]: np.pv(0.08/2, 10, 42500, 1000000, 0)                                    
    Out[2]: -1020277.2394483876

The investor will therefore pay R1020277 today for an investment with the above amounts

If interest rates went to 9% the value of the bond would be:

    In [3]: np.pv(0.09/2, 10, 42500, 1000000, 0)                                    
    Out[3]: -980218.2045572248

### Bond Yields

* price of a bond = expected cash flow and required yield
* yield of a bond = coupon payments, income from reinvestment of coupons received, capital gains/losses on the market value of the bond

* Nominal yield - coupon rate

#### Current yield

    current_yield = annual_yield / market_price

The current yield for a 15 year, 7% coupon bond with a par value of R1000 selling for R769.4:

    annual_yield = R1000 * 0.07 = 70

    current_yield = 70 / 769.4
    current_yield = 9.1%

> Only the coupon interest rate is taken into account. Capital gain, loss and time value of money is ignored

#### Yield to Maturity

**Interest rate that will make the present value of a bond's remaining cash flows equal to the price**

Eg. A 15 year bond with a 7% coupon bond with a maturity value of R1000 and a current value of R769.4

Future value = R1000
Periods = 15 * 2 = 30
Present value = - R769.4
Payment = 7% * R1000 = R70 / 2 = R35

yield to maturity (rate) = ?

    In [10]: np.rate(30, 35, -769.4, 1000, 0)
    Out[10]: 0.05000103851314496


* A bond selling at **par** has a `current yield == yield to maturity`
* A bond selling at **discount** has `current yield < yield to maturity`
* A bond selling at a **premium** has `current yield > yield to maturity`

### Yield Curves

A plot of yields to maturity

#### Pure Expectations Theory

* Average of short term rates that are expected in the future
* If short term rates are expected to rise, interest rate yields on longer maturities will be higher than those on short maturities. Yield curve is upward sloping. 
* If short term rates are expected to fall, the longer maturity bonds will offer lower yields. Downward sloping.

#### Liquidity Preference Theory

* Investors require a risk premium for holding longer-term bonds
* Interest rate risk is greater for longer maturity bonds

#### Market Segmentation Theory

* Investors and borrowers have different preferences for maturity ranges.
* Supply and demand for different maturity ages affect yield
* Age of Investor
* Regulations and policy restrictions

### Yield Curve Shapes

* Rising yield curve - longer maturities flatten out
* Declining yield curve - longer maturities flatten out
* Flat yield curve - equal
* Humped yield curve - yield on intermediate-term issues are above short-term

### Duration

* Term to maturity is the number of years until redmeption
* Longer the maturity of the bond, the more sensitive it is tochanges in interest rate
* Duration of a bond compares bonds by measuring their cash flows over a weighted period of time
* Duration and volatility of a bond increases as teh term to maturity increases
* A longer term bond will be affected more by an increase in interest rate as the loss of potential income on the ten-year bond will be greater than on the fice year bond.

### Convexity

* Amount of a bonds price change when interest rates change
* Sensitivity to change in interest rate

    bond_volatility = percentage_change_price / change_current_interest_rates

Say interest rates go from 10% to 12%. The bond price goes down 20%. Bond volatility = 10.

### Bond Price Quotations

* The R186 bond was issued at an initial yield of 10.5%.
* If interest rates are lower than 10.5% in 2026, the government is likely to redeem the bonds and issue stock at a lower rate.
* Bonds are not quoted in rands and cents, but in terms of intrest rates.
* The current spot price is `8.74` or `8.74%`
* If yield goes up, price or value of the bond will decline
* If yield comes down, price or value of the bond will increase.
* The are not user friendly
* You need to calculate:
    * yield to maturity
    * clean price - excluding accrued interest
    * interest accrued
    * total price
    * running yield - interest paid on the bonds dividend by the clean price
    * duration of the bond

## Securitisation

* Converting illiquid financial assets (mortages and debtor's accounts) into negotiable transfer instruments
* Cash flow is redirected into a negotiable debt instrument
* Corporate liquidity is usually enhanced and the assets remain on the balance sheet
* Lending risks: investment, interest rate, liquidity and credit risk are allocated to parties best able to absorb them

> Always take tax into account when calculating income from bonds

# The Property Market

* Property is valuable because it can be used and is relatively scarce
* They are heterogeneous - differ from each other
* Not easy to convert into use as a different purpose
* Illiquid investment

## Factord affecting value

* Political, social and economic
* Interest rates - buyers need to raise a mortgage to buy a house
* Costs involved - transfer duty, conveyancing costs, bond registration costs, estate agent's commissions

## Returns from property

* Rental income
* Increase in capital

If interest rates rise, the property owner can find themselves in a situation where the cost of borrowing rises faster than the rental income received. 

> A change in yield can have a considerable impact on the value of a property

    capitalisation_rate = 100 / rate_of_return

    property_value = rental_return_per_annum * capitalisation_rate

Eg. Income from a property per annum is R120000, the rate of return is 10%.

    property_value = 120000 * (100/10)
    R1,200,000

If the rate of return goes to 12%

    property_value = 120000 * (100/12)
    R1,000,000

Therefore capital growth is achieved when current market yield decreases or if the rental income increases.

* The interest rates affect the market yield
* If interest rates decline, the value of the property is likely to increase

    capitalisation_rate = (first_year_net_operating_income / purchase_price) * 100

* The first year's net operating income is the initial yield
* If a building is rented below market rentals, the initial yield will be below the capitalisation rate
* The capitalisation rate is a good tool in comparing properties

## Direct Property Investment

Factors affecting property value:

\* Price relative to similar properties
* Reputable area - stability
* developments near property
* condition - hints at future maintenance costs
* crime rate

#### Mortgaging a property

* High interest rates dictate that the best investment an individual can make would be to repay the mortgage if they cannot claim mortgage interest as a deduction.
* Tex deductible is for commercial and industrial buildings
* Investor may want to maximise borrowing if it is tax deductible but must ensure the outstanding value of the loan does not exceed the value of the property

> Individuals who own their own homes should pay off their mortgage over a shorter time

* Paying off the mortgage is a low risk investment strategy
* Contrasting that to a bond rate of 10.5% and a marginal tax rate of 35%, paying off a bond is a much better investment.
* There are no additional fees and VAT on the payments

* If the increase in housing prices lag behind inflation then it makes a house (and mortgage for it) a bad investment
* Sometimes the return from rented property may not cover the cost of owning the property
* Then it is whether rentals will rise or capital gains will compensate for the loss on rentals

#### Costs of Purchasing Property

* Transfer duty is payable unless the property is bought directly from the developer or builder. In that case VAT is charged.
 * Conveyancing fees - 1 to 2% to the price

 Getting a bond for R1600000 on a R2000000 house would have the following costs:
 * Bond registration costs including VAT: R22686
 * Bank initiation fee including VAT: R5985
 * Post, Petties and FICA: R1200
 * Property Transfer Costs: R25650
 * Transfer Duty: R60500

 You can expect to pay: R117221 in costs

 Then to rent the property out there are a few costs:
 * Estate agent to find tenant: 5%
 * Management: 10%
 * Money spent on repairs, rates, levies and insurance

The investment return is calculated by subtracting expenses from total income.

Expenses:

\* Loan Repayment
* Sectional Title Levy
* Freehold property Rates
* Insurance Premiums
* Allowances for repairs and maintenance (12.5% of monthly rental)

Income:

\* Rental of lease agreement
* Less agent's colelction fee

Eg. The rental of a R400000 property would need:

Bond repayment: R4128
Levy: R600
Rates: R400
Insurance: R55
Maintenance: R400

Total: R5583

The rent needs to be more than that

#### Sectional Title

* Part owner of the land and common property
* Complex is controlled by a body corporate
* Owner of any section of the building is a member of the body corporate

#### Time Share

* Holdiay accomdation
* Ownership of sectional title units for 1 week of the 52 in a year
* Demand for particular weeks differ, making some hard to sell.
* Levies must be adequate to cover costs and major repairs
* More of a saving on future costs than an investment

#### Share Block Schemes

* Right of occupancy in a specific section of a building in which the invetor owns shares
* As shares are being purchased the investor would be required to take out a personal loan which may result in higher interest rates

#### Retirement Villages

* Only sell if 75% of holders agree.
* Income tax exemption for the company involved in residential accomadation

#### Property Syndications

**TL;DR Stay away**

* Group of investors who pool funds in order to purchase commercial or industrial property
* Units are sold for R10000
* A single investor cannot control more than 25%
* Income is received quarterly
* Paid out as percentage of rental income based on shareholding
* Not very liquid investments
* Large instituitional investors are usually the first to take up desired projects
* South Africa has been plagued with distrous property syndication schemes
* Experience has shown that one cannot rely on the opinions of the promoters when assessing the investment of a particular proposal.

Keep in mind:

\* Track record of people
* who are tenants when are the leases in place
* actual rentals compared to market
* location; is it desirable?
* cash reserves to cover major refurbishment
* design of building
* access services and building services are adequate
* company's constitution
* restrictions on transferability
* who will manage the company
* Will income cover the cost of borrowing
