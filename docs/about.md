## About Fixes.co.za

This website is a repo of documentation, notes, summaries, fixes and solutions on software development and related topics.
It mainly serves as a personal reference for my research, studies and findings.

I primarily develop web related services and deliver cloud solutions. The fields of web development, automation and cloud services is so wide and expansive. These fields touch on a multitude of topics across the entire technology spectrum.

> There is always new and (great) old things to learn and the cool thing is you are free to choose what you learn and at what depth

### How to Contribute
